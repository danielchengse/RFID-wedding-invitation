This is an Arduino hardware system that complements a GUI software to check in and display to wedding guests their seating arrangements via an RFID tag attached to the wedding invite. 

To scan the RFID tag, the tag is placed on top of the box holding the RFID scanner. To make sure that the system has scanned the RFID properly, an audio queue will go off as well as a green flash from an RGB LED. Once scanned properly, the system will display the seating arrangement of the guest. Also, for each table, the monitor will notify the guests if they have won a table centerpiece. The system will work in conjunction with a display from the computer to show the information.
